![newplot (27)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/751c9788-a697-4c0c-b547-755f5114c93e)
- The elbow was clearly observed at **K = 3**, suggesting:
  - Three clusters provide a **well-balanced trade-off** between model complexity and cluster compactness.
  - Segmenting the companies into three groups captures the **most meaningful variance** in the data without overfitting.

![newplot (28)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/449d00fc-23fb-4a8c-9f13-70f37b321c91)
- Axes
  - **X-Axis**: PCA Component 1
  - **Y-Axis**: PCA Component 2

- Clusters
  - **Cluster 0 (Red)**: Dispersed, above and to the right.
  - **Cluster 1 (Green)**: A lone point far to the right.
  - **Cluster 2 (Blue)**: Tightly grouped near the origin.
  
- Insights

![newplot (29)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90b5632b-5d09-41b8-ad24-780900054ab6)
This heatmap shows the linear correlation between various financial variables (such as Revenue, Net Income, EPS) and the results of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and Clustering.

- The closer the color is to yellow (positive values), the stronger the positive correlation; blue/purple tones indicate negative correlation.

- For example:

  - Pre_Tax_Profit_2024 is strongly positively correlated with Net_Income_2024 and Profit_After_Tax_2024.

  - PCA1 shows a noticeable positive correlation with some revenue-related variables like Revenue_2024, indicating that the principal components capture core financial features.

- The heatmap also reveals redundancy—some features are highly correlated and might be conveying overlapping information, which is useful for dimensionality reduction or feature selection.


![newplot (30)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58070a36-098c-4685-b008-d989cd9db74c)

- X-axis: Cluster group labels (Cluster 0, 1, 2)

- Y-axis: Revenue_2024 (represented in scientific notation or log scale)

- Key takeaways:

  - Cluster 1 has a noticeably higher median revenue—companies in this group tend to have large revenues.

  - Cluster 0 consists of lower-revenue companies.

  - Cluster 2 shows a wider range, with a few outliers, but most of the companies are still in the mid-to-low revenue range.

  
### Assignment 4: Advanced 2019-2023 Financial Report Analysis with Machine Learning
[Task Link Path](https://github.com/KyleHung7/programming-language/blob/main/Week_8_Advanced_2019_2023_Financial_Report_Analysis.ipynb)

![newplot (40)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3f5b43a-29f4-45ca-afab-f5b0159e1326)

The graph shows the relationship between the number of clusters (K) and inertia (SSE), helping identify the optimal number of clusters. 

- **X-axis**: Number of clusters, ranging from 2 to 10.
- **Y-axis**: Inertia (SSE), spanning approximately 45,000 to 75,000.

The plotted line demonstrates:
- A sharp decrease in inertia between **K=2** and **K=4**.
- A more gradual descent from **K=4** to **K=10**.

The **elbow point**, visible around **K=4**, marks the point where inertia begins to decrease at a slower rate, indicating the best number of clusters for the dataset.

- **Axes**: 
  - **X-axis**: PCA Component 1
  - **Y-axis**: PCA Component 2

- **Clusters**:
  - Data points are color-coded to represent four clusters (red, blue, green, and purple).
  - **Red and blue clusters**: Dense and located near the origin.
  - **Green and purple clusters**: More dispersed and further from the origin.

This visualization highlights the use of PCA for dimensionality reduction and K-Means clustering to separate distinct groups within a dataset.


![newplot (42)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5cfb46a-438b-47dd-864a-89169b992090)

This heatmap visualizes the correlation between multiple features, helping to identify relationships for data analysis or machine learning tasks. 

- **Color Gradient**: 
  - Dark purple represents low correlation.
  - Bright yellow indicates high correlation.

- **Scale**: 
  - A bar on the right displays the correlation range, spanning from 0 to 1.

- **Axes**: 
  - Features are labeled in Chinese characters along both the x-axis and y-axis.

This heatmap effectively highlights areas of high and low correlation among features, aiding in insightful data exploration.


![newplot (43)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f24a159a-39bd-4630-ad38-be912d2118f1)

- **Y-axis**: 營業收入 (NT$) (Operating Revenue in NT$).
- **X-axis**: Cluster Group (0, 1, 2, 3).

### Cluster Details:
- **Cluster 0**: A diverse group with a wide range of revenue values and multiple outliers. This cluster includes companies from various industries, such as 嘉泥, 環泥, 幸福, 信大, 東泥, and more.
- **Cluster 1**: Features a more concentrated revenue range with fewer outliers. Key representatives are 台泥, 亞泥, 統一, 台塑, 南亞, and others.
- **Cluster 2**: Consists solely of 鴻海, with a single revenue value.
- **Cluster 3**: Represents 台積電, showing a single value with significantly higher revenue compared to the other clusters.

This visualization emphasizes the variation in operating revenue among the clusters, highlighting the dominance of specific companies in Clusters 2 and 3.
