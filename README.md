![newplot (27)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/751c9788-a697-4c0c-b547-755f5114c93e)
- The elbow was clearly observed at **K = 3**, suggesting:
  - Three clusters provide a **well-balanced trade-off** between model complexity and cluster compactness.
  - Segmenting the companies into three groups captures the **most meaningful variance** in the data without overfitting.

![newplot (28)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/449d00fc-23fb-4a8c-9f13-70f37b321c91)
- Axes
  - **X-Axis**: PCA Component 1
  - **Y-Axis**: PCA Component 2

- Clusters
  - **Cluster 0 (Red)**: Dispersed, above and to the right.

![newplot (29)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90b5632b-5d09-41b8-ad24-780900054ab6)
This heatmap shows the linear correlation between various financial variables (such as Revenue, Net Income, EPS) and the results of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and Clustering.

- The closer the color is to yellow (positive values), the stronger the positive correlation; blue/purple tones indicate negative correlation.

- For example:

  - Pre_Tax_Profit_2024 is strongly positively correlated with Net_Income_2024 and Profit_After_Tax_2024.

  - PCA1 shows a noticeable positive correlation with some revenue-related variables like Revenue_2024, indicating that the principal components capture core financial features.

- The heatmap also reveals redundancy—some features are highly correlated and might be conveying overlapping information, which is useful for dimensionality reduction or feature selection.


![newplot (30)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58070a36-098c-4685-b008-d989cd9db74c)

- X-axis: Cluster group labels (Cluster 0, 1, 2)

- Y-axis: Revenue_2024 (represented in scientific notation or log scale)

- Key takeaways:

  - Cluster 1 has a noticeably higher median revenue—companies in this group tend to have large revenues.

  - Cluster 0 consists of lower-revenue companies.

  - Cluster 2 shows a wider range, with a few outliers, but most of the companies are still in the mid-to-low revenue range.

  
### Assignment 4: Advanced 2019-2023 Financial Report Analysis with Machine Learning
[Task Link Path](https://github.com/KyleHung7/programming-language/blob/main/Week_8_Advanced_2019_2023_Financial_Report_Analysis.ipynb)

![newplot (40)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3f5b43a-29f4-45ca-afab-f5b0159e1326)

The graph shows the relationship between the number of clusters (K) and inertia (SSE), helping identify the optimal number of clusters. 

- **X-axis**: Number of clusters, ranging from 2 to 10.
- **Y-axis**: Inertia (SSE), spanning approximately 45,000 to 75,000.

The plotted line demonstrates:
- A sharp decrease in inertia between **K=2** and **K=4**.
- A more gradual descent from **K=4** to **K=10**.

The **elbow point**, visible around **K=4**, marks the point where inertia begins to decrease at a slower rate, indicating the best number of clusters for the dataset.

### Cluster Details:
- **Cluster 0**: A diverse group with a wide range of revenue values and multiple outliers. This cluster includes companies from various industries, such as 嘉泥, 環泥, 幸福, 信大, 東泥, and more.
- **Cluster 1**: Features a more concentrated revenue range with fewer outliers. Key representatives are 台泥, 亞泥, 統一, 台塑, 南亞, and others.
- **Cluster 2**: Consists solely of 鴻海, with a single revenue value.
- **Cluster 3**: Represents 台積電, showing a single value with significantly higher revenue compared to the other clusters.

This visualization emphasizes the variation in operating revenue among the clusters, highlighting the dominance of specific companies in Clusters 2 and 3.

#### 1. Top 20 Most Frequent Words

This bar chart shows the words that appear most frequently in the analyzed text after filtering out single characters and common stop words.

![newplot (48)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31604d68-5464-4e58-8398-4065c63f517a)


##### **Interpretation:**

The most prominent words like "金融" (Finance), "智慧" (Intelligence), "銀行" (Bank), "人工" (Artificial), "監管" (Regulation), "2025", and "科技" (Technology) clearly indicate that the text focuses heavily on the domain of Finance and Technology, particularly discussing Artificial Intelligence, regulation, and looking towards the year 2025. This confirms the text's theme as a prediction or outlook on the future of FinTech.

#### 2. Distribution of Named Entity Types

This pie chart illustrates the breakdown of different types of named entities (e.g., organizations, dates, persons, locations) identified within the text by CKIPtagger.

![newplot (49)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f14ee8b-b57e-403f-adb4-a85f9bd9879e)


##### **Interpretation:**

The dominant entity types are:

* **ORG (Organization)**: Making up 50%, highlighting that the text frequently refers to various companies, institutions, or bodies within the FinTech landscape.
* **DATE**: Accounting for 31.8%, directly reflecting the text's focus on predictions and events related to specific timeframes, primarily the year 2025 as seen in the word frequency analysis.
* **CARDINAL**: Representing 6.82%, suggesting the presence of numerical data or figures within the text.

The smaller proportions of categories like PERSON and GPE indicate that the text's focus is more on the industry trends and organizations rather than specific individuals or geographical locations.

## Conclusion

The CKIPtagger analysis provided valuable insights into the core themes and key entities discussed in the Chinese FinTech text. The combination of word frequency and named entity recognition allowed for a structured understanding of the document's content, revealing the emphasis on future trends, AI, regulation, and the organizations driving these changes within the financial technology sector. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using NLP tools like CKIPtagger for extracting meaningful information from specialized Chinese texts.
