### Assignment 3: Advanced 2024 Q3 Financial Report Analysis with Machine Learning
[Task Link Path](https://github.com/KyleHung7/programming-language/blob/main/Week_6_Advanced_2024_Q3_Financial_Report_Analysis_with_Machine_Learning.ipynb)
- Apply **PCA and K-Means clustering** (using the **elbow method** to determine the optimal number of clusters).
- Perform **one-hot encoding** for categorical data.
- Use a **heatmap** to compare correlations between different fields.
- Visualize clustering results with **box plots**.
![newplot (27)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/751c9788-a697-4c0c-b547-755f5114c93e)
- The elbow was clearly observed at **K = 3**, suggesting:
  - Three clusters provide a **well-balanced trade-off** between model complexity and cluster compactness.
  - Segmenting the companies into three groups captures the **most meaningful variance** in the data without overfitting.

![newplot (28)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/449d00fc-23fb-4a8c-9f13-70f37b321c91)
- Axes
  - **X-Axis**: PCA Component 1
  - **Y-Axis**: PCA Component 2

- Clusters
  - **Cluster 0 (Red)**: Dispersed, above and to the right.
  - **Cluster 1 (Green)**: A lone point far to the right.
  - **Cluster 2 (Blue)**: Tightly grouped near the origin.
  
- Insights
  - Demonstrates **PCA** for dimensionality reduction.
  - Highlights **K-Means**' ability to uncover clusters.

![newplot (29)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90b5632b-5d09-41b8-ad24-780900054ab6)
This heatmap shows the linear correlation between various financial variables (such as Revenue, Net Income, EPS) and the results of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and Clustering.

- The closer the color is to yellow (positive values), the stronger the positive correlation; blue/purple tones indicate negative correlation.

- For example:

  - Pre_Tax_Profit_2024 is strongly positively correlated with Net_Income_2024 and Profit_After_Tax_2024.

  - PCA1 shows a noticeable positive correlation with some revenue-related variables like Revenue_2024, indicating that the principal components capture core financial features.

- The heatmap also reveals redundancy—some features are highly correlated and might be conveying overlapping information, which is useful for dimensionality reduction or feature selection.


![newplot (30)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58070a36-098c-4685-b008-d989cd9db74c)
This is a box plot that visualizes the distribution of 2024 revenue across different clusters:

- X-axis: Cluster group labels (Cluster 0, 1, 2)

- Y-axis: Revenue_2024 (represented in scientific notation or log scale)

- Key takeaways:

  - Cluster 1 has a noticeably higher median revenue—companies in this group tend to have large revenues.

  - Cluster 0 consists of lower-revenue companies.

  - Cluster 2 shows a wider range, with a few outliers, but most of the companies are still in the mid-to-low revenue range.
